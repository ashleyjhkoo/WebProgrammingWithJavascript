## What was the mission?
In this mission, you will modify an existing HTML page that uses inline style attributes so that it instead uses an external CSS file.

In completing this assignment, you will:

Gain experience reading, understanding, and working with existing HTML

Apply what you have learned about CSS classes and styling

### Activity
As discussed in the lessons, one of the drawbacks of using inline CSS is that it can lead to large amounts of repetitive code, which can be difficult to maintain and change. As you see in this example, there are many places in which the styling has been copied & pasted to create different elements, and if something were to change, it would be manually intensive.

In this assignment, you are asked to modify, or “refactor,” the existing HTML code so that it uses an external CSS file instead of inline CSS.

Start by creating a file called calendar.css (you must name it this for grading purposes!) and use the <link> tag in the header of calendar.html to link it to that page.

Then create CSS rules in calendar.css based on the “style” attributes of the HTML elements in calendar.html. Group the rules together based on elements’ “class” attributes and/or HTML element types, keeping the exact same styling rules.

When you are finished putting the CSS rules in calendar.css, delete the “style” attributes for all HTML elements in calendar.html. If you did this correctly, the rendered HTML page should still look exactly the same!
